Static constructors have the following properties:

- **A static constructor doesn't take access modifiers or have parameters**.
- A class or struct can only have one static constructor.
- Static constructors can't be inherited or overloaded.
- A static constructor can't be called directly and is only meant to be called by the common language runtime (CLR). It's invoked automatically.
- The user has no control on when the static constructor is executed in the program.
- A static constructor is called automatically. It initializes theÂ [class](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class)Â before the first instance is created or any static members declared in that class (not its base classes) are referenced. A static constructor runs before an instance constructor. If static field variable initializers are present in the class of the static constructor, they run in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration. The initializers run immediately before the static constructor.
- If you don't provide a static constructor to initialize static fields, all static fields are initialized to their default value as listed inÂ [Default values of C# types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/default-values).
- If a static constructor throws an exception, the runtime doesn't invoke it a second time, and the type remains uninitialized for the lifetime of the application domain. Most commonly, aÂ [TypeInitializationException](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.typeinitializationexception)Â exception is thrown when a static constructor is unable to instantiate a type or for an unhandled exception occurring within a static constructor. For static constructors that aren't explicitly defined in source code, troubleshooting might require inspection of the intermediate language (IL) code.
- The presence of a static constructor prevents the addition of theÂ [BeforeFieldInit](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.reflection.typeattributes#system-reflection-typeattributes-beforefieldinit)Â type attribute. This limits runtime optimization.
- A field declared asÂ `static readonly`Â can only be assigned as part of its declaration or in a static constructor. When an explicit static constructor isn't required, initialize static fields at declaration rather than through a static constructor for better runtime optimization.
- The runtime calls a static constructor no more than once in a single application domain. That call is made in a locked region based on the specific type of the class. No extra locking mechanisms are needed in the body of a static constructor. To avoid the risk of deadlocks, don't block the current thread in static constructors and initializers. For example, don't wait on tasks, threads, wait handles or events, don't acquire locks, and don't execute blocking parallel operations such as parallel loops,Â `Parallel.Invoke`Â and Parallel LINQ queries.
