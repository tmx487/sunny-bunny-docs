A Git branching strategy is crucial for managing development, bug fixes, and deployment across various environments. The chosen strategy must suit business needs while enabling efficient feature development and bug resolution without causing conflicts between teams or delaying delivery.

In this blog, I’ll introduce a **3-branch strategy** that is adaptable to most business cases. It supports ongoing feature development and allows the support team to handle bug fixes independently, ensuring that production remains stable and reliable.

The three primary branches used in this strategy are:

1. **Master (or Main)**: The single source of truth for production.
2. **Hotfix**: Dedicated to bug fixes and urgent patches.
3. **Development**: The branch for new feature development.

By using these three branches, development and support work can progress without interruption, and changes can be integrated smoothly when ready for production deployment.
